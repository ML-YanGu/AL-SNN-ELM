# AL-SNN-ELM
The AL-SNN-ELM considers the exploration and exploitation simultaneously in the framework of active learning, which has a significant performance improvement in comparison with the traditional AL-ELM algorithm
# Requirement
1. Matlab 2018b
2. twenty datasets
# Results
Extensive experiments on twenty UCI benchmark data sets show that the proposed AL-SNN-ELM algorithm has a significant performance improvement in comparison with the traditional AL-ELM algorithm
